<p><strong>Thailand</strong> (Thai: ประเทศไทย) is a country in <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>. Before 1939, it was called the <strong>Kingdom of Siam</strong>. The latter is bordered to the southwest and northwest by <strong>Burma</strong>, to the south by <strong>Malaysia</strong>, to the southeast by <strong>Cambodia</strong> and to the northeast by <strong>Laos</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Thai culture, influenced by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouddhisme">Buddhism</a> and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindouisme">Hinduism</a>, is very old. It shares many points in common with that of neighbouring countries
</p>

<h2>Religion</h2>
<p><strong>94.6%</strong> of Thais are <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouddhistes">Buddhists</a>, <strong>4.6%</strong> are <strong>Muslims</strong>, <strong>0.7%</strong> are <strong>Christians</strong>, and the rest are of various religions. The <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmanisme">Brahmanist</a> pilgrimage site plays an important role in traditional Thai religion, influenced by India.</p>

<h2>Custom</h2>
<p>One of the Thai customs is the <strong>"Waï"</strong>, a greeting gesture very similar to the <strong>Namaste</strong> of the Indians. Used for hello, Farewell(=adieu), it appears in different styles that all have the same meaning: normally a Thai makes a "bow(=révérence)" with his hands as a gesture of prayer.<br>
<br>
Public displays of affection are common between friends but very rarely between <strong>men and women</strong>.Therefore, it is very rare to see couples kissing or holding hands. Touching someone's head or placing your foot at someone's head level is considered rude. Indeed, Thais consider the foot to be a dirty and coarse part of the body, while the head is a noble and elevated part. This influenced the way Thais sit; The feet are placed on the side of the body, a little hidden, avoiding showing them to others. Pointing to or touching things with the foot is considered a vulgar action.</p>
