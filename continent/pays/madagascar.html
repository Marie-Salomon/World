<p>Majority of the Malagasy population adheres to Christianity, with practitioners of Protestantism slightly outnumbering adherents to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Madagascar">Roman Catholicism</a>.4.6% of the Island's population is solely adherent to the traditional religion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakalava_people">Fomba-gasy</a>, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famadihana">famadihana</a>, whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere.</p>
