</p>


<p>It is a <strong>Southeast</strong> Asian country made up of an <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipel">archipelago</a> of 7,641 islands, eleven of which total more than 90% of the land and of which only a little more than 2,000 are inhabited, while about 2,400 islands have not even been named.

There are three geographical areas: <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%A7on_(Philippines)">Luzon</a> Island, the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visayas">Visayas</a> archipelago and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao">Mindanao</a>. Luzon, the largest and northernmost island, is home to its capital, <strong>Manila</strong>, and the country's largest city, <strong>Quezon City</strong>. 
The country has maritime borders with <strong>Taiwan</strong> to the north, <strong>Japan</strong> to the northeast, <strong>Palau</strong> to the east and southeast, <strong>Indonesia</strong> to the south, <strong>Malaysia</strong> to the southwest, <strong>Vietnam</strong> to the west, and <strong>China</strong> to the northwest.
</p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>It is a mix of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langues_malayo-polyn%C3%A9siennes">Malayo-Polynesian</a> and <strong>Hispanic</strong> cultures, with influences from <strong>Chinese</strong> culture.

The Philippines was first occupied by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9lan%C3%A9sie">Melanesians</a>; Today, they preserve a very traditional way of life and culture, although they are few in number. Their culture is still very visible, whether in the ethnic type, language, food, dance, etc.
<strong>Spanish</strong> colonization, which lasted more than three centuries, had a profound impact on the national culture. The Philippines, ruled from both <strong>Mexico and Spain</strong>, received a bit of each other's culture. Their influences are evident in <strong>Catholic religious practices</strong>, such as masses and feasts. In the first half of the twentieth century, the Philippines became a <strong>U.S.</strong> territory: the influence of the United States is noticeable in the widespread use of the English language and in modern popular culture.
