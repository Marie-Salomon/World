<h2>Geography</h2>
<p><strong>Afghanistan</strong>, in long form de facto the <strong>Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</strong>, is a landlocked country in South Asiab or Central Asia surrounded by <strong>Uzbekistan</strong> to the north, <strong>China and Tajikistan</strong> to the northeast,<strong> Pakistan</strong> to the east-southeast, <strong>Iran</strong> to the west, and <strong>Turkmenistan</strong> to the northwest.</p>

<h2>history of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</h2>
<p>The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is the name of a <strong>political regime</strong> in Afghanistan. It was founded between 1996 and 1997 by the <strong>Taliban</strong>, and ended with their fall in 2001. It was reinstated in August 2021, following an offensive that began after the announcement of the withdrawal of US troops from the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerre_d%27Afghanistan_(2001-2021)">Afghanistan war</a>.<br>
Taliban are <strong>Islamic fundamentalists grouped in a military, political and religious organization</strong> called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and then the Islamic Movement of the Taliban, in power between 1996 and 2001 and since 2021. This movement is led by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haibatullah_Akhundzada">Haibatullah Akhundzada</a>, who was proclaimed Commander of the <strong>Faithful of the emirate</strong> on May 25, 2016.<br>

The movement, at war with the Islamic State of Afghanistan government, conquered <strong>Kabul </strong>in 1996 and established the regime of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from 1996-2001 under <strong>Mullah Mohammad Omar</strong>. However, he never controlled the entire country and was overthrown by the intervention of the<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_du_trait%C3%A9_de_l%27Atlantique_nord"> North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) in 2001, against which he then waged a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%C3%A9rilla">guerrilla war</a><br>
The Taliban were also guilty of <strong>human rights violations</strong>, particularly with regard to the <strong>treatment of women</strong>, who were forbidden to work, attend public and university education. Afghan <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communisme">communists</a> were systematically <strong>executed and thieves punished</strong> by amputation of one of their hands or feet. However, the Taliban managed to eradicate <strong>opium</strong> production from the country almost completely, although it resumed after the <strong>US invasion</strong> of the country in 2001.</p>

<h2>link with Al-Qaeda</h2>
<p>On August 30, 2021, <strong>Amin-ul-Haqq</strong>, a senior al-Qaeda official, returned to<strong> Nangarhar</strong> province. Several Taliban and many civilians came to meet him.
<br>
According to a UN report published in February 2022, the Taliban's seizure of power strengthened al-Qaeda, <strong>which has since enjoyed greater freedom of movement and recruitment</strong>. Al-Qaeda's forces are estimated to have between 200 and 400 members. The al-Qaeda leadership has chosen to remain discreet in Afghanistan so as not to hinder the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan's efforts to gain international recognition</p>
