<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The culture of Ireland includes the customs and traditions, language, music, art, literature, folklore, cuisine, and sports associated with Ireland and the Irish people. For most of its recorded history, Irish culture has been predominantly Gaelic. She was also influenced by Anglo-Norman, English and Scottish culture.<br>
Due to the large-scale emigration of Irish people, Irish culture has a global reach, and festivals such as <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%AAte_de_la_Saint-Patrick">St. Patrick's Day</a> and Halloween are celebrated around the world. Irish culture has been somewhat inherited and modified by the Irish diaspora, which in turn has influenced the country of origin. While there are many unique aspects of Irish culture, it shares substantial characteristics with those of Britain, other English-speaking countries, other predominantly Catholic European countries, and other Celtic countries.
