<h2>Fauna and flora</h2>
<p>Although most of the country is <strong>desert or semi-arid</strong>, Australia has no shortage of diverse natural habitats to support different animal and plant species. For some of the animals on this continent, scientists speak of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9gafaune_australienne">Australian megafauna</a>. Due to the highly variable climate of this territory and its very long isolation, a particular fauna and flora have been able to develop, such as <strong>wingless birds</strong>, or the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotremata">monotreme</a> and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupialia">marsupial</a> mammals, which preceded in evolution the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria">placental</a> mammals. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds and 89% of fish on the continental shelf are considered <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/End%C3%A9misme">endemic</a> species. The most well-known animal species are the koala, kangaroo, wallaby, emu, platypus, wombat, echidna and dingo.

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>For 50,000 years, the Aborigines have eaten a cuisine based on animals and plants native to their region:<strong> grilled kangaroos, seafood, honey, berries, etc.</strong>

Beginning in 1788, English cuisine brought to the country by early settlers became the basis of Australian cuisine. It consists of pies, meat, mainly beef and lamb, but also sometimes kangaroo: <strong>steaks, grilled chops and others usually accompanied by vegetables.</strong></p>
