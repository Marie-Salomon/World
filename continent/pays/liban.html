<p><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_du_Liban">Lebanon's constitution</a> is not secular but multi-confessional: the country has a political system based on a distribution of power proportional to the demographic weight of each faith, taken into account as a constituent community in the image of the old <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_de_l%27Empire_ottoman">Ottoman system</a> of "religious nations" or <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_(Empire_ottoman)">"millets"</a>.</p>



<h2>Geography</h2>
<p><strong>Lebanon</strong>, a country in the Levant (Near East), is a narrow strip of land bordered by the <strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong> on 240 km of coastline. 250 km long and 25 to 60 km wide, it has a border with <strong>Syria</strong> for 376 km and with <strong>Israel</strong>, to the south, for 79 km. Its area is officially 10,452 km2, although this measure, which has significant political symbolism in <strong>Lebanon</strong>, is technically subject to debate
</p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Beyond the differences linked to the institutional and political importance of the communities, a set of structuring traits common to the Lebanese are identifiable: <strong>linguistic Arabism, political autonomy, common history and, for many of them, the French-speaking world.</strong>

Thus, the <strong>Lebanese entity</strong> finds its raison d'être through the experience of dialogue between religions. In the age of globalization, it can offer a privileged meeting place between the <strong>Westand the East</strong> and <strong>cultural pluralism </strong>constituting a common heritage.<br>
The <strong>thousand-year-old</strong> quest for Lebanese identity must therefore transcend disparate elements belonging to the same coherent whole to ensure this function of being a space of <strong>communication, autonomy, openness, influence, solidarity and "cultural resistance"</strong>. This is why Ghassan Tueni wrote <div class="citation">"not to remake Lebanon is to definitively renounce the only geographical place where concrete dialogue can take place between <strong>Islam and Christianity</strong> can still be attempted in the politics lived out on a daily basis".</div>
