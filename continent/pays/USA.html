<p>The United States, in long form the United States of America, also informally called the USA or less exactly America or the States, is a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_%C3%89tats_transcontinentaux">transcontinental state</a> whose majority of the territory is located in North America. The United States has the political structure of a republic and a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tat_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ral">federal state</a> with a presidential system, consisting of fifty states. The <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitale">federal capital</a>, Washington, is located in the District of Columbia, an area landlocked in the Union, but outside the fifty states. The currency is the U.S. dollar. There is no official language in the United States, although the national language is de facto American English.</p>


<h2>culture</h2>
<p>When it comes to twentieth-century popular music, the United States is the<strong> birthplace of gospel, jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, rock 'n' roll, soul, house music, disco, funk, jazz fusion, and rap.</strong> American popular music stars such as <strong>Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Eminem have become global celebrities</strong>.<br>
<br>
Since the end of the <strong>nineteenth century</strong>, the United States has been at the forefront of the world for <strong>scientific research</strong> and <strong>technical innovation</strong>. In <strong>1876, Alexander Graham Bell</strong> filed a patent for the invention of the <strong>telephone</strong>. <strong>Thomas Edison's laboratory</strong> developed the <strong>phonograph, the incandescent lamp and one of the first cameras</strong>. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the companies of<strong> Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford</strong> experimented with new ways of <strong>producing motor vehicles</strong>. In <strong>1903, the Wright brothers</strong> made one of the <strong>first flights by airplane.</strong></p>


<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Since the end of the eighteenth century, religion has been officially separated from the state and this principle is guaranteed by the constitution (Article VI and the First Amendment). In the constitution and in the Bill of Rights, there is never any reference to God or Providence174. However, it is found on the American currency: "In God We Trust" has been the national currency since 1956 and has been declared legally compatible with the constitution. Nevertheless, the federal government does not subsidize any religious school in the name of religious freedom173. Since 1962, prayer in schools has been prohibited by the Engel v. Vitale judgment174. Finally, it should not be forgotten that the First Amendment guarantees non-interference by the state in religions and freedom of worship.
